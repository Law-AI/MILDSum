The Madras High Court recently set a unique condition for bail for a man accused of drunken driving. While granting bail, the bench of Justice AD Jagadish Chandira, directed the petitioner Deepan to distribute pamphlets against "Drunken Driving" everyday in the morning and evening for a period of two weeks.
 The petitioner shall report before the respondent Police, every day at 9.00 a.m. and 5.00p.m., and he shall distribute the pamphlets against "Drunken Driving" at the LB Road Junction, Chennai everyday from 9.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m., for a period of two weeks and thereafter, report before the respondent Police as and when required;
 Deepan was arrested and remanded to judicial custody on 23rd August for drunken driving and for causing hurt. Deepan, in an inebriated state, had driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner causing injuries to the pedestrians and then fled away from the scene of occurrence.
 While seeking bail, the petitioner contended that he was an innocent man. It was also brought to the attention of the court that the victims had been discharged from the hospital. Further, the petitioner had been in prison since 23rd August and had to take care of the family. The state vehemently opposed the grant of bail.
 After considering the facts and circumstances, the court was inclined to grant bail on certain conditions.
