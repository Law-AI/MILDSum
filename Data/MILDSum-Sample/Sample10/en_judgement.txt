The petitioner is before this Court calling in question
registration of crime in Crime No.115 of 2020 for offences
punishable under Sections 506, 504, 143, 147, 149, 323, 324 and
363 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and has sought quashment of
the charge sheet filed for offences punishable under Sections 143,
147, 323, 324, 365, 504, 506 r/w 149 of IPC,      Section 3(1)(r) &
3(1)(s)   of  the Scheduled    Castes   and the   Scheduled  Tribes
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (‘the Act’ for short) and also
called in question consequential order of taking cognizance for the
aforesaid offences in the charge sheet.
2. Heard Sri Jaysham Jayasimha Rao, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioner and Smt. K.P.Yashodha, learned High
Court    Government    Pleader  appearing    for   respondent   No.1.
Respondent      No.2/complainant      though     served     remained
unrepresented throughout these proceedings.
3. Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts as projected by the
prosecution are as follows:-
A complaint comes to be registered by the 2nd respondent on
14-06-2020 alleging that the petitioner along with others had
indulged in certain acts which would become punishable under
Sections 506, 504, 143, 147, 149, 323, 324 and 363 of the IPC.
Though the complaint was that certain abuses were made against
the son of the 2nd respondent, the FIR comes to be registered only
for offences punishable under the IPC as afore-quoted. The
background to the allegation is a game of cricket. The son of the
complainant and the petitioner along with their friends had played
cricket match in which the son of the complainant and his team had
lost the match, due to which, some altercations took place between
the petitioner and the son of the complainant and his friends.
Several allegations are made to the effect that the son of the
complainant was taken away and beaten. It is in that light the FIR
comes to be registered against the petitioner and one Punit. The
Police conduct investigation, record statements of several persons
who during their statements have revealed that certain abuses in
filthy language were made by the petitioner and others on the son
of the 2nd respondent and others. Based upon those statements a
charge sheet comes to be filed including the offences punishable
under the Act. The learned Sessions Judge in terms of        his order
dated 01-03-2021 takes cognizance of the offences so alleged in
the charge sheet and registers as Special Case No.55 of 2021 for
offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 323, 324, 365, 504,
506 r/w 149 of IPC and Section 3(1)(r) & (s) of the Act. It is this
order of taking cognizance that drives the petitioner to this Court in
the subject petition.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would
contend with vehemence that there was no hurling of abuses as is
alleged and all the allegations sprang because of a game of cricket
that has gone wrong previous day.       The complaint comes to be
registered initially for offences punishable under the IPC. While
recording statements, it appears that several players in the game
had made statements before the Investigating Officer that there
were abuses hurled while the game was being played and,
therefore, the offences under the Act are included. He would submit
that mere hurling of abuses without any intention to insult or make
casteist remarks would not become an offence under the Act. He
would further contend that the entire investigation conducted qua
the Act is in violation of Rule 7 of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 (‘the Rules’
for short).
5. On the other hand, the learned High Court Government
Pleader appearing for the 1st respondent would vehemently refute
the submissions to contend that hurling of abuses is proved.
Merely   because    there  was   rivalry   between  the  son  of the
complainant and the petitioner and his friends which arose out of
cricket match it cannot be made a tool for quashment of the
proceedings    under   Section   482    of  the  Cr.P.C.  She  would
vehemently oppose the petition to contend that it is always open to
the Investigating Officer while filing the final report to add offences
that come about during the course of investigation. No fault can be
found with the act of the Investigating Officer including the offences
under the Act while filing final report. Intention or otherwise of the
petitioner in hurling abuses is a matter of trial. Since the charge
sheet is already filed, the Court should not interfere with any of the
offences so alleged and permit trial to be concluded, as it is for the
petitioner to come out clean in the trial.
6. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions
made by the respective learned counsel and have perused the
material on record.
7. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The complaint
comes to be registered by the 2nd respondent on 14.06.2020
alleging that her son had been beaten/kidnapped and assaulted.
Based on the complaint so registered by the 2nd respondent, a
crime comes to be registered in Crime No.115 of 2020 for offences
punishable under Sections 506, 504, 143, 147, 149, 323, 324 and
363 of IPC.     Since the crime comes to be registered for the
aforesaid offences on the basis of the complaint, I deem it
appropriate        to      notice       the     complaint.           The          complaint     dated
14-06-2020 reads as follows:

The allegation in the complaint is that the son of the complainant
one Manoj and his friend Pradeep were having food near a shop on
14-06-2020 at about 4.30 p.m. At that time, the petitioner along
with 30 people comes there with two wheeler vehicles and a car
and while hurling abuses against the son of the complainant and
another attacked them with weapons and beer bottles causing
bloodstained injuries and also assaulted them after taking them in
the car. There was no complaint made that the petitioner had
hurled abuses taking the name of the caste of the son of the
complainant. The allegation was only using filthy language and
threatening the life of the son of the complainant. Accordingly, , the
aforesaid crime comes to be registered.
8. The Investigating Officer conducts investigation and while
doing so, he records statements of several persons who were
participants in the game of cricket. In such statements he comes
across certain statements made by the witnesses that abuses were
hurled using filthy language that would become offences under the
Act. It is, therefore, while filing the charge sheet, the offences
under the Act are invoked. The summary of the charge sheet which
assumes significance in the light of addition of offences under the
Act reads as follows:

A perusal at the summary of the charge sheet would indicate all
offences under the IPC.               Insofar the offences under the Act is
concerned, what is narrated is only that as an outcome of the game
of cricket certain altercations happen between the complainant and
the accused and the accused has abused the complainant taking the
name of his caste. Except this statement, there is no whisper about
the petitioner having hurled abuse taking the name of the caste of
the complainant intentionally to insult or humiliate by making
castiest remarks.
9. The learned Sessions Judge in terms of his order dated
01.03.2021 takes cognizance of the offences so alleged in the
charge sheet and registers it as Special Case No.55 of 2021. The
issue is, whether the allegations would become ingredients of the
offences under the Act?
10. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has
vehemently contended that there was no intention, even if it is
accepted that the abuses were hurled taking the name of the caste.
The intention to insult a particular caste is an important ingredient
to bring home the offence. The summary of the charge sheet, as
quoted hereinabove, only narrates the allegation of assault,
kidnapping and fight between the two and the reason for the fight
being the game of cricket. While doing so, it is alleged that the
petitioner and others have indulged in assaulting the son of the
complainant by beer bottles and weapons which would clearly
demonstrate that both the son of the complainant and the
petitioner were in an inebriated state.     The only sentence that is
used in the summary of charge sheet is that while hurling of abuses
the name of the caste of the son of the complainant is taken.
Statements in the charge sheet do not indicate that the name of the
caste of the son of the complainant was taken deliberately with an
intention to insult the son of the complainant.
11. If there was no intention of the kind to humiliate, it would
not become an offence under Section 3(1)(r) & (s), is what the
Constitutional Courts have held. Before considering the judgments
so rendered by the Constitutional Courts, I deem it appropriate to
notice Section 3(1)(r) & (s) of the Act. Section 3 of the Act deals
with punishments for offences of atrocities. Section 3(1)(r) and (s)
“3. Punishments for offences of atrocities.—(1)
Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled
(r)   intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a
member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any
place within public view;
(s)   abuses any member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled
Tribe by caste name in any place within public view.”
Section 3(1)(r) mandates that whoever intentionally insults or
intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste
or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view.                Section
3(1)(s) would mandate that if any person is seen to have abused
the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe by caste name in any place
within public view. Therefore, the soul of the provision is intention.
The insult should be intentional and the intimidation should be with
intent to humiliate a member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled
Tribe.     As observed hereinabove, the charge sheet or the
statements do not narrate any other circumstance except saying
that the name of the caste of the son of the complainant was also
used when abuses were hurled.             There is no narration of any
intention to insult or humiliate taking the name of the caste either
in the statements or in the summary of the charge sheet.
12. The Apex Court in the case of HITESH VERMA v. STATE
OF UTTARAKHAND1 has held as follows:-
“17. In     another     judgment        reported     as Khuman
Singh v. State of M.P. [Khuman Singh v. State of M.P., (2020) 18
SCC 763 : 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1104] , this Court held that in a
case for applicability of Section 3(2)(v) of the Act, the fact
that the deceased belonged to Scheduled Caste would not be
enough to inflict enhanced punishment. This Court held that
there was nothing to suggest that the offence was
committed by the appellant only because the deceased
belonged to Scheduled Caste. The Court held as under:
“15. As held by the Supreme Court, the offence must
be such so as to attract the offence under Section 3(2)(v) of
the Act. The offence must have been committed against the
person on the ground that such person is a member of
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. In the present case,
the fact that the deceased was belonging to “Khangar”
Scheduled Caste is not disputed. There is no evidence to
show that the offence was committed only on the ground
that the victim was a member of the Scheduled Caste and
therefore, the conviction of the appellant-accused under
Section 3(2)(v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is not sustainable.”
18. Therefore, offence under the Act is not established
merely on the fact that the informant is a member of
Scheduled Caste unless there is an intention to humiliate a
member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe for the
reason that the victim belongs to such caste. In the present
case, the parties are litigating over possession of the land. The
allegation of hurling of abuses is against a person who claims title
over the property. If such person happens to be a Scheduled Caste,
the offence under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act is not made out.”
(Emphasis supplied)
The Apex Court in the aforesaid paragraphs clearly holds that the
offence under the Act is not established merely on the fact that the
informant is a member of Scheduled Caste, unless there is an
intention to humiliate a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled
Tribe for the reason that the victim belongs to such caste.            The
Apex Court narrates that both the victim and the accused therein
were in a squabble with regard to a land dispute. In the case at
hand, there is no indication of any intention to insult or humiliate
and the reason for the squabble between the two was the game of
cricket.    A co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of
LOKANATH v. STATE OF KARNATAKA2 has held as follows:
“13. Unless the investigation indicates or reveals
intention of a person not belonging to scheduled caste or
scheduled tribe to commit any of the offences under Section
3 of the Act, in order to oppress or insult or humiliate or
subjugate or ridicule a member of scheduled caste or
scheduled tribe as such person merely belongs to that caste,
the offence under Section 3 cannot be invoked in the charge
sheet. It is not as though in every crime, if victim happens to be a
member of scheduled caste or scheduled tribe, an offence under
Section 3 of the Act has been committed. If motive for crime is not
casteist attack, the accused can only be charge sheeted for any of
the offences under Penal Code, 1860 that can be appropriately
invoked in the background of the incident of crime or under other
law which can be applied as the facts and circumstances indicate.
While the Act is essentially meant for protecting the
members of scheduled caste or scheduled tribe from atrocity
or oppression, at the same, it cannot be allowed to be
misused. Therefore there is greater responsibility on the
investigating officer to take decision wisely before filing the
charge sheet.”
The co-ordinate Bench also holds that there should be an intention
to oppress or insult or humiliate or subjugate or ridicule a member
of a Scheduled Caste by taking the name of the caste. If there is no
motive or intention to insult it cannot become an offence under the
Act. The High Court of Orissa in a judgment rendered on 19-12-
2022 in SURENDRA KUMAR MISHRA v. STATE OF ORISSA3
following the Apex Court judgment in the case of HITESH VERMA
has held that intention is the soul of Section 3(1)(r) & (s) of the Act
and if there is no intention the offence cannot even be laid against
those accused. The High Court of Orissa has held as follows:
9. In the present case, as it appears the incident happened
at a public place when some road work was in progress. Whether at
the relevant point of time any other member of the public was
present or not is not revealed from Annexure-1. Even accepting
for a while that the alleged incident was at a time when
other members of the public were present, the question
would still be whether the petitioner did commit the overt
act with any intention to insult and intimidate the informant
on account of him belonging to SC or ST? Intention is a sine
qua non for the alleged offence to have been committed. In
other words, unless the required intention is found to exist
with a purpose to insult and intimidate the victim the latter
(CRLMC No.2628 of 2013)
being a member of SC or ST, no offence under Section
3(1)(x) of the SC & ST (PoA) Act can be said to have been
made out. The Apex Court in Hitesh Verma (supra)
examined the Legislative intention behind the enactment of
SC&ST (PoA) Act and noted down the Statement of Objects
and Reasons which indicated that the existing laws like
protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and other provisions of
the IPC were found to be inadequate to safeguard the
interest and rights of members of SC and ST as crimes have
been committed taking advantage of their caste and
backwardness. So having regard to the intent and purpose
of the law in place meant to protect the statutory and
constitutional rights of the marginalized sections of the
society, any such offence committed by a person other than
a SC or ST must have to have the requisite intention to insult
and intimidate his counterpart for him to be from a
backward class because of his caste. So it has to be held
that all insults or intimidation do not make out an offence
under the Act unless it is directed against the person on
account of his caste.
10. The petitioner suddenly out of anger abused the
informant under the circumstances narrated in annexure-1.
No doubt petitioner took the name of the informant’s caste
while abusing the latter. By taking the caste name or
utterances of abuse by taking the name of one’s caste would
not be an offence under Section 3(1)(x) of the SC & ST
(PoA) Act unless the intention is to insult, intimidate the
person being a SC or ST. If the law laid down by the
Supreme Court in Hitesh Verma (supra) is read, appreciated
and understood in its proper perspective and applied to the
case at hand, there appears no such intention on the part of
the petitioner for being in dominant position as a man of
forward class to insult and intimidate the informant being a
member of SC and ST. If the victim is humiliated within public
view for being SC or ST and with that intention, any overt act or
mischief is committed, an offence under Section 3(1)(x) of the
SC%ST (PoA) Act would be made out otherwise not. Though the
informant was abused at a public place or may be within public
view by taking his caste name but as it is made to appear from the
conduct of the petitioner, it was apparently without any intention to
insult, intimidate and to humiliate him. It was pure and simple an
abuse by the petitioner under the peculiar facts and circumstances
and a sudden outburst and on the spur of the moment without
carrying the requisite intention to humiliate the informant so to
say. Therefore the contention of Mr. Mohapatra to the aforesaid
extent is acceptable and justified and not beyond.”
(Emphasis supplied)
If the law laid down by the Apex Court, the co-ordinate Bench of
this Court and even that of the High Court of Orissa is juxtaposed
what would unmistakably emerge is, mere taking the name of the
caste of the victim would not make it an offence, unless it is with an
intention to insult the person belonging to the said caste. That
being conspicuously absent in the case at hand, permitting further
proceedings to continue qua the offences under the Act would
become an abuse of the process of law.
13. Yet another ground that is urged by the learned counsel
for the petitioner is with regard to Rule 7 of the Rules. Rule 7 reads
“7. Investigating Officer.—(1) An offence committed
under the Act shall be investigated by a Police Officer not
below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. The
Investigating Officer shall be appointed by the State
Government, Director-General of Police, Superintendent of
Police after taking into account his past experience, sense of
ability and justice to perceive the implications of the case
and investigate it along with right lines within the shortest
possible time.
(2) The investigating officer so appointed under sub-rule (1)
shall complete the investigation on top priority within thirty days
and submit the report to the Superintendent of Police who in turn
will immediately forward the report to the Director General of Police
of the State Government.
(3) The Home Secretary and the Social Welfare Secretary to
the State Government, Director of Prosecution the officer in-charge
of Prosecution and the Director General of Police shall review by the
end of every quarter the position of all investigations done by the
investigating officer.”
Rule 7 depicts who should be the Investigating Officer. Sub-rule (1)
of Rule 7 mandates that the Investigating Officer should be
appointed by the State Government after taking into account his
past experience, sense of ability and justice to perceive the
implications under the Act and investigate along the right lines.
Sub-rule    further  mandates     that    the  investigation    should   be
conducted by a Police Officer not below the rank of Deputy
Superintendent of Police.
14. It is an admitted fact that the investigation, in the case at
hand, is conducted by the Police Sub-Inspector and charge sheet is
filed by the Police Sub-Inspector. Therefore, there is violation of
Rule 7 of the Rules, inasmuch as there is no order directing
investigation to be conducted by the Deputy Superintendent of
Police. This again is in violation of Rule 7, which would vitiate the
proceedings is what the Apex Court has held in the case of STATE
OF MADHYA PRADESH v. BABBU RATHORE4.                         The Apex Court
“8. For appreciating the rival submissions, we need to refer
Section 9 of the 1989 Act and Rule 7 of the 1995 Rules which are
“9. Conferment of powers. — (1) Notwithstanding
anything contained in the Code or in any other provision of
this Act, the State Government may, if it considers it
necessary or expedient so to do,—
(a)    for the prevention of and for coping with any offence
(b)    for any case or class of group of cases under this Act,
in any district or part thereof, confer, by notification in the Official
Gazette, on any officer of the State Government the powers
exercisable by a police officer under the Code in such district or part
thereof or, as the case may be, for such case or class or group of
cases, and in particular, the powers of arrest, investigation and
prosecution of persons before any Special Court.
(2) All officers of police and all other officers of Government
shall assist the officer referred to in sub-section (1) in the
execution of the provisions of this Act or any rule, scheme or order
made thereunder.
(3) The provisions of the Code shall, so far as may be, apply
to the exercise of the powers by an officer under sub-section (1).”
“7. Investigating officer.—(1) An offence committed
under the Act shall be investigated by a police officer not
below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police. The
investigating officer shall be appointed by the State
Government/Director General of Police/Superintendent of
Police after taking into account his past experience, sense of
ability and justice to perceive the implications of the case
and investigate it along with right lines within the shortest
possible time.
(2) The investigating officer so appointed under sub-
rule (1) shall complete the investigation on top priority within
thirty days and submit the report to the Superintendent of
Police who in turn will immediately forward the report to the
Director General of Police of the State Government.
(3) The Home Secretary and the Social Welfare
Secretary to the State Government, Director of Prosecution,
the officer in charge of prosecution and the Director General
of Police shall review by the end of every quarter the position
of all investigations done by the investigating officer.”
9. By virtue of its enabling power, it is the duty and
the responsibility of the State Government to issue
notification conferring power of investigation of cases by
notified police officer not below the rank of Deputy
Superintendent of Police. Rule 7 of the 1995 Rules provides
rank of investigation officer to be not below the rank of
Deputy Superintendent of Police. An officer below that rank
cannot act as investigating officer in holding investigation in
reference to the offences committed under any provisions of
the 1989 Act but the question arose for consideration is that
apart from the offences committed under the 1989 Act, if
the offence complained are both under IPC and the offence
enumerated in Section 3 of the 1989 Act and the
investigation being made by a competent police officer in
accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (hereinafter being referred to as “the Code”), the
offences under IPC can be quashed and set aside for non-
investigation of the offence under Section 3 of the 1989 Act
by a competent police officer. This question has been
examined by a two-Judge Bench of this Court in State of
M.P. v. Chunnilal [State of M.P. v. Chunnilal, (2009) 12 SCC
649 : (2010) 1 SCC (Cri) 683] . Relevant para is as under:
(SCC pp. 651-52, paras 7-8)
“7. … By virtue of its enabling power it is the
duty and responsibility of the State Government to
issue a notification conferring power of investigation
of cases by notified police officer not below the rank of
Deputy Superintendent of Police for different areas in
the police districts. Rule 7 of the Rules provided rank
of investigating officer to be not below the rank of
Deputy Superintendent of Police. An officer below that
rank cannot act as investigating officer.
8. The provisions in Section 9 of the Act, Rule 7
of the Rules and Section 4 of the Code when jointly
read lead to an irresistible conclusion that the
investigation of an offence under Section 3 of the Act
by an officer not appointed in terms of Rule 7 is illegal
and invalid. But when the offence complained are both
under IPC and any of the offence enumerated in
Section 3 of the Act the investigation which is being
made by a competent police officer in accordance with
the provisions of the Code cannot be quashed for non-
investigation of the offence under Section 3 of the Act
by a competent police officer. In such a situation the
proceedings shall proceed in an appropriate court for
the offences punishable under IPC notwithstanding
investigation and the charge-sheet being not liable to
be accepted only in respect of offence under Section 3
of the Act for taking cognizance of that offence.”
(Emphasis supplied)
The Apex Court interpreting Rule 7 holds that it is the duty of the
State to issue a notification conferring investigation of cases by
notified Police Officers not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent
of Police and if it is not, it would clothe other rank Officers to
conduct investigation. But, the Apex Court found therein that the
investigation    was    conducted   by   the   Competent    Authority.
Nonetheless, the Apex Court holds that it is imperative that Rule 7
be adhered to.
15. Long before the judgment of the Apex Court in BABBU
RATHORE (supra), the High Court of Orissa in the case of
AKSHAYA KUMAR PARIDA v. STATE OF ORISSA5 has held as
“6. The second submission of Mr. Parida is that the order of
cognizance must be quashed as the statutory provision of Rule 7 of
the Rules has been violated during investigation of the case. Rule 7
of the aforesaid Rules mandates that a case involving offences
under S.C. and S.T. (P.A.) Act should be investigated by an officer
not below the rank of D.S.P. The case diary shows that
investigation of the case was undertaken by one A.S.I. of
Mancheswar Police Station and the said officer recorded the
statements of the witnesses. At a later stage of investigation, it was
found that offence under section 3 of S.C. and S.T. (P.A.) Act is
also involved and the Superintendent of Police, Bhubaneshwar
directed the I.O. to hand over the investigation of the case to Mr.
D.N. Satpathy, D.S.P., Bhubaneswar. The said D.S.P. after taking
over the investigation tested the witnesses, made supervision and
then submitted charge-sheet.
contemplated under Rule 7 of the aforesaid rules in the
strict sense was not done by an officer of the rank of D.S.P.
So for violation of the mandates contained in Rule 7 of the
aforesaid rules, the order of cognizance under section 3 of
the S.C. and S.T. (P.A.) Act against the petitioner is legally
vulnerable. However, the order of cognizance so far as
offences under sections 341, 294 and 506, I.P.C., are
concerned, cannot be faulted as investigation of such
offence by a police officer below the rank of D.S.P. is not
barred.”
In the light of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court in the
case of BABBU RATHORE (supra) and that of the Orissa High
Court in the case of AKSHAYA KUMAR PARIDA, what would
unmistakably emerge is that any investigation conducted by an
officer below the rank of Superintendent of Police who would not be
with particular traits as narrated under sub-rule (1) of Rule 7 of the
Rules would vitiate the proceedings.
16. The learned High Court Government Pleader places
reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of
RAMVEER UPADHYAY v. STATE OF U.P.6 to contend that the
proceedings should not be nipped in the bud in exercise of
jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. as in certain cases it
would be a matter of evidence.         The Apex Court therein had
affirmed the order of the High Court which had dismissed the
petition which was on the plea that there was political rivalry
between the victim and the accused and, therefore, the offences
were alleged.       Merely because there was political rivalry, the FIR
should not be nipped in the bud is what the Apex Court holds. The
facts obtaining in the judgment of the Apex Court are clearly
different from what is obtaining in the case at hand and, therefore,
become distinguishable without much ado. The case on hand is not
at the stage of FIR.         The charge sheet is filed and in the charge
sheet the offences under the Atrocities Act are alleged. The Apex
Court did not consider the question with regard to intention to
insult, as the stage of such consideration had not yet arrived in the
case before the Apex Court. The Apex Court at paragraph 39 has
“39. In our considered opinion criminal proceedings cannot
be nipped in the bud by exercise of jurisdiction under Section 482
of the Cr.P.C. only because the complaint has been lodged by a
political rival. It is possible that a false complaint may have been
lodged at the behest of a political opponent. However, such
possibility would not justify interference under Section 482 of the
Cr.P.C. to quash the criminal proceedings. As observed above, the
possibility of retaliation on the part of the petitioners by the acts
alleged, after closure of the earlier criminal case cannot be ruled
out. The allegations in the complaint constitute offence under the
Atrocities Act. Whether the allegations are true or untrue, would
have to be decided in the trial. In exercise of power under Section
482 of the Cr.P.C., the Court does not examine the correctness of
the allegations in a complaint except in exceptionally rare cases
where it is patently clear that the allegations are frivolous or do not
disclose any offence. The Complaint Case No. 19/2018 is not such a
case which should be quashed at the inception itself without further
Trial. The High Court rightly dismissed the application under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.”
Therefore, the said judgment is of no assistance to the learned High
17. Insofar as the other offences are concerned, there is
undoubtedly material right from the complaint till the charge sheet
for offences punishable under Sections 323, 324, 365, 504 and 506
of IPC which are all to be tried. There is ample evidence in the
statements and the narration in the summary of the charge sheet
albeit prima facie to bring home those offences.         It is for the
petitioner to come out clean in the offences under the IPC. Since
the offences are grave in nature, there can be no interference
insofar as offences under the IPC are concerned.
18. For the aforesaid reasons, I pass the following:
(i)      Criminal Petition is allowed in part.
(ii)     Charge sheet No.19 of 2020 dated 23-12-2020 of
Suryanagar Police Station, Anekal Taluk insofar as it
concerns offences under the Scheduled Castes and
the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,
1989 stands quashed.
(iii) The order taking cognizance by the learned Sessions
Judge for offences punishable under the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act, 1989 also stands quashed.
(iv)  The offences alleged under the IPC are all sustained
and further proceedings are permitted to continue
qua the offences under the IPC before the
